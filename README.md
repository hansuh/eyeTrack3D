This application is tracking the position of your eyes. As the changes of your perspective view angle, the app renders the corresponding 3D graphic space on your display giving you an interactive 3D experience of the virtual space.

It uses ‘***face-api.js’*** for facial recognition and ***‘three.js’*** for the 3D graphic environment.
